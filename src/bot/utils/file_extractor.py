"""Validate arbitrary file paths for Telegram document delivery.

Used by the MCP ``send_file_to_user`` tool intercept — the stream callback
validates each path via :func:`validate_file_path` and collects
:class:`FileAttachment` objects for later Telegram delivery.

Full security validation lives here (not in the MCP tool itself) so the tool
can run without access to the bot's runtime configuration. A path that passes
the tool-side syntactic check but fails here is logged as a warning and the
user sees a short error summary; Claude has already received "queued" but the
file simply never arrives.
